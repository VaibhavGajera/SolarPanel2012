        <br /><br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Both monocrystalline (mono) and polycrystalline (poly) solar panels
          serve the same function in the overall solar PV system: they capture
          sunlight and convert it into electricity. The cells of both are made
          from silicon, which is a semiconducting material. The difference
          between the two technologies stem primarily from the production
          process of the silicon wafers.
        </p>
        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="speed-2">Visual differentiators:</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Polycrystalline panels have a blue hue while monocrystalline solar
          panels have a black appearance (although some bluish reflections can
          be observed depending on the light). Another visual difference
          noticeable as a result of the production process is that mono cells
          are not always rectangles because they are missing corners which is
          because they were cut from a round rod. However, also mono cells can
          sometimes be shaped perfectly rectangular. The panels on the picture
          are also different because the poly panels is full cell while the
          mono panel is a half-cell panel.

        <br /><br />
        <h2 class="speed-2">Monocrystalline process:</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Mono ingots are formed from a pure refined silicon in a pulling
          process. This process involves a crystal rod that is dipped into
          molten silicon and rotated as it is raised back out. Each time this
          is performed the ingot grows into a larger single crystal as the
          layers of silicon are aligned by this process. The name
          “mono-crystalline” indicates that the wafer is made from
          single-crystal silicon. In mono wafers the electrons that generate a
          current have more room to move, making monocrystalline solar panels
          more efficient.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="speed-2">PERC:</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Mono solar panels are communicated nearly everywhere as mono PERC
          panels. PERC stands for “passivated emitter and rear contact” or
          “rear cell”. Solar panels built with these cells have an additional
          layer on the back of the cell. This additional layer allows more
          sunlight to be captured by reflecting unabsorbed light back into the
          cell for more efficiency.

        <br /><br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          A few years ago, polycrystalline panels were the mainstream solution
          and made up the vast majority of all PV panels installed and sold.
          We used to sell both poly and mono panels. Over time the constantly
          improving price to performance ratio of mono PV panels has largely
          caused poly technology to be replaced. Our current PV portfolio only
          consists of mono half-cell panels, offering optimal performance and
          value for our customers.

        <h2 class="speed-2">Solar Cell production industry structure</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          In the PV industry, the production chain from quartz to solar cells
          usually involves 3 major types of companies focusing on all or only
          parts of the value chain: 1.) Producers of solar cells from quartz,
          which are companies that basically control the whole value chain.
          2.) Producers of silicon wafers from quartz – companies that master
          the production chain up to the slicing of silicon wafers and then
          sell these wafers to factories with their own solar cell production
          equipment. 3.) Producers of solar cells from silicon wafers, which
          basically refers to the limited quantity of solar PV module
          manufacturers with their own wafer-to-cell production equipment to
          control the quality and price of the solar cells.

        <br /><br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          Thin-film solar panels are made up of thin-film solar cells. They
          are manufactured using several layers of light-absorbing materials,
          stacked on top of each other. The materials should not be thick as
          they absorb light. Thin-film solar cells are easy to use and are
          lightweight, making them durable.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h2 class="speed-2">Top 3 types of thin-film solar cells</h2>
        <br />
        <p class="paragraph">
          1. Amorphous solar cells These cells are made of silicon and are
          widely used for their abundance and low cost. They are very thin,
          and one layer is the size of one micrometre. <br />
          2.Copper gallium indium diselenide These cells are made of Copper,
          Indium, and Selenide, layered on top of each other. The thin layer
          of these thin-film solar panel cells provides flexibility. <br />
          3. Cadmium telluride These are the most popular thin-film solar
          panel cells used today. They are made from thin layers of cadmium
          telluride. They can absorb sunlight from a close or shorter
          wavelength than traditional solar cells. Wavelengths that are more
          concise help in easily converting sunlight into electricity.
